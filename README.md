Abstractâ€” This paper presents a real-time heart rate tracking system leveraging the AD8232 ECG sensor and ESP-32 microcontroller to monitor cardiac activity and transmit data to a mobile application. The AD8232 sensor captures ECG signals, which the ESP-32 processes and forwards to a cloud database using Firebase. A user-friendly interface built on Flutter visualizes the heart rate and raw ECG data. The system aims to provide an affordable, portable, and reliable solution for continuous cardiac monitoring, aiding in early detection of anomalies. Integrating IoT and cloud technologies ensures accessibility and scalability, making it suitable for personal health management and remote patient monitoring.
